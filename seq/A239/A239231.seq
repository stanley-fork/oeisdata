%N A239231 Heyawake numbers: maximum number of painted cells in an n X n grid, such that no two painted cells are orthogonally adjacent and the unpainted cells form a contiguous area.
%C A239231 Inspired by the Japanese puzzle of the same name.
%H A239231 Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heyawake">Heyawake</a>.
%F A239231 For n > 4, a(n) >= A239072(n-4) + 2*n - 2.
%e A239231 For n=6, the painted cells could be A1, A3, A6, B5, C1, C3, D4, D6, E2, F1, F4, F6 (a(6)=12 cells in all, equal to the lower bound given in the Formula section):

%e A239231 For n=7, a(7) is equal to the lower bound 17. The unique solution comes from the A239072(3) = 5 painted cells enclosed into a frame of unpainted cells and then into the outer frame in which every other cell is painted, including the corners:
